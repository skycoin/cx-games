# Whacky Stack 
(a Tetris clone)

After deleting the 2 abandoned, non-functional Tetris-clone folders, I went back in the repo history to see what kind of textures the game had.  After looking at the textures, I started thinking about the logic involved in this kind of game, and thought it might be fairly easy to write (from scratch) without taking too much time.
